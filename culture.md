We care about a friendly culture in our lab, so we have a series of activities to foster a collaborative atmosphere. You can get an impression on our <a href="https://goo.gl/photos/v1rN6bs6qBzSQYLL7">photo album</a>. Salt Lake City is a great place to do research, but also to play! Skiing, climbing, mountain biking, etc. is all immediately accessible in the vicinity. We have a [code of conduct](../conduct) that details how we expect our lab members to collaborate.

## Group Meetings

We meet weekly as a group to discuss a research paper, give feedback on research proposals, give test-talks for conferences, and build other soft-skills. Our meetings include all our PostDocs, PhD students, and software engineers, but also MS and BS students interacting with the group.

## Group Retreat

Once a year we do something fun for a group retreat. Here are some pictures from these events.

### 2023 Social

2023 had a lot of events, so we didn't do a retreat, but celebrated Haihan's defense.

## Group Run

We used to jog together every Tuesday and Thursday pre-covid! Check out our <a href="https://www.strava.com/clubs/vdl-running">Strava Club</a>. Maybe we'll get back to it sometime.
