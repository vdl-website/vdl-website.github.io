## Our Expectations

The open exchange of ideas and the freedom of thought and expression are central to the aims and goals of the visualization design lab. As a lab, we are committed to providing a harassment-free, accessible, inclusive, and pleasant scholarly environment with equity in rights for all. We want every lab member to feel welcome, included, and safe in their membership.

We aim to provide a safe, respectful, and harassment-free scholarly environment for everyone involved regardless of age, sex, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, (dis)ability, physical appearance, race, ethnicity, nationality, marital status, military status, veteran status, religious beliefs, dietary requirements, medical conditions, pregnancy-related concerns, or childcare requirements. We also respect any other status protected by laws in the United States of America.

We do not tolerate harassment of others in any way, shape, or form. We expect all interactions between lab members and others to be respectful and constructive, including interactions during the lab meetings, at the lab itself and on social media. Lab participants who violate the terms of this policy may be asked to leave the laboratory and forfeit any rights therein.

Concerns should be brought to the attention of the lab director in person (if needed) and definitely in writing, and will be investigated by the lab to the fullest extent possible and in accordance with University of Utah policies. If there is an immediate need for intervention, outside law enforcement authorities may need to be contacted.

## Relevant University of Utah Policies

The Americans with Disabilities Act. The University of Utah seeks to provide equal access to its programs, services, and activities for people with disabilities. If you will need accommodation, reasonable prior notice needs to be given to the Center for Disability Services, 162 Olpin Union Building, 801-581-5020. CDS will work with you and the lab director to make arrangements for accommodations.

Addressing Sexual Misconduct. Title IX makes it clear that violence and harassment based on sex and gender (which includes sexual orientation and gender identity/expression) is a civil rights offense subject to the same kinds of accountability and the same kinds of support applied to offenses against other protected categories such as race, national origin, color, religion, age, status as a person with a disability, veteran’s status or genetic information. If you or someone you know has been harassed or assaulted, you are encouraged to report it to the Title IX Coordinator in the Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action, 135 Park Building, 801-581-8365, or the Office of the Dean of Students, 270 Union Building, 801-581-7066. For support and confidential consultation, contact the Center for Student Wellness, 426 SSB, 801-581-7776. To report to the police, contact the Department of Public Safety, 801-585-2677(COPS).

Code of Conduct. Students are required to abide by the Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities (the “Student Code”) for the University of Utah. The Student Code for the University of Utah can be found [here](http://regulations.utah.edu/academics/6-400.php). Students are responsible for being aware of the information contained therein.
