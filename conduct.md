## Our Expectations

The open exchange of ideas and the freedom of thought and expression are central to the aims and goals of the visualization design lab. As a lab, we are committed to providing a harassment-free, accessible, inclusive, and pleasant scholarly environment with equity in rights for all. We want every lab member to feel welcome, included, and safe in their membership.

We aim to provide a safe, respectful, and harassment-free scholarly environment for everyone involved regardless of age, sex, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, (dis)ability, physical appearance, race, ethnicity, nationality, marital status, military status, veteran status, religious beliefs, dietary requirements, medical conditions, pregnancy-related concerns, or childcare requirements. We also respect any other status protected by laws in the United States of America.

We do not tolerate harassment of others in any way, shape, or form. We expect all interactions between lab members and others to be respectful and constructive, including interactions during the lab meetings, at the lab itself and on social media. Lab participants who violate the terms of this policy may be asked to leave the laboratory and forfeit any rights therein.

Concerns should be brought to the attention of the lab director in person (if needed) and in writing, and will be investigated by the lab to the fullest extent possible and in accordance with University policies. If there is an immediate need for intervention, outside law enforcement authorities may need to be contacted.
