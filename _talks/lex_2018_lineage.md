The majority of diseases that are a significant challenge for public and individual heath are caused by a combination of hereditary and environmental factors. The Utah Population Database is a unique resource to study these multifactorial diseases. Incorporating familial relationships between cases with other data can provide insights into shared genomic variants and shared environmental exposures that may be implicated in such diseases. The analysis of this data, however, is challenging. In this talk, we will introduce Lineage, a novel visual analysis tool designed to support domain experts who study psychiatric multifactorial diseases with UPDB data.
