abstract: "Most logging approaches record system events at a fairly low level of abstraction. In this talk, I will argue that higher levels of abstraction are possible and desirable. I will highlight opportunities for increasing semantics that software developers have by carefully recording meaningful events. I will then show that we can leverage algorithmic methods to infer user-intents. Finally, I will show opportunities for eliciting key information from insights directly from users. Explicitly asking users about their intentions has benefits for users, as they can later retrace their steps more efficiently, and system developers, as they can learn more about usage patterns of their system and motivations of their users. There are diverse user input modalities that can provide information at different levels of abstraction and invasiveness.  These modalities range from multiple choice responses, to structured notes, to “think-aloud-like” approaches. In combination, these approaches are promising for building systems that have a better understanding of their users and hence can support users in their analytical tasks.
