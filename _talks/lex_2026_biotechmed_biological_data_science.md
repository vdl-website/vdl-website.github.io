abstract: "Interactive data visualization is central to modern data science, particularly within the life sciences. It enables researchers to directly engage with their data, quickly explore hypotheses, and uncover patterns with minimal friction. Visualization solutions range from highly specialized tools designed for specific biological challenges to flexible, general-purpose libraries used across domains.

In this talk, I will present two examples at opposite ends of this spectrum. The first is a bespoke, domain-specific visualization system developed to address the complex task of analyzing live-cell microscopy data. The second demonstrates how interactive visualizations can be seamlessly integrated with Python code in Jupyter Notebooks, creating a powerful environment for exploratory analysis. Together, these examples highlight both the current landscape and future potential of visualization in biological data science.
