abstract: "Traditional empirical user studies tend to focus on testing aspects of visualizations or perceptual effects that can be fully controlled. Evaluating or comparing complex interactive visualization techniques, in contrast, is much more difficult, as complexity increases confounders. This challenge is aggravated when using crowdsourcing for evaluation, as crowd participants tend to be novices with limited motivation for excelling at a task. In this talk I will introduce methods to run and analyze such studies for complex visualization techniques, including procedural suggestions for crowdsourced studies, design of stimuli for testing, instrumentation of stimuli, and analysis of user behavior based on the data collected."
