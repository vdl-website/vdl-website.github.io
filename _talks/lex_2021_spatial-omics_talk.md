abstract: "Spatial omics analysis poses great challenges for data visualization as large data vectors are collected on dense, spatially located biological entities. However, there are parallels to other data types where location or topology are imperative: maps and networks. I will give an overview of the challenges encountered when analyzing spatial omics data, and highlight parallels and differences to maps and networks. I will then speculate on how visualization techniques for maps and networks could be leveraged for spatial omics data."
