abstract: "Today, scientific discovery is increasingly data-driven and enabled by computational tools. However, there are many aspects of the data science process for which purely automatic approaches do not suffice. In a typical data analysis scenario, reasoning and incorporating contextual knowledge is essential, and when decisions are ultimately made by humans, they need to be knowledgeable about the data and the methods applied. In my talk I will show how to enable this interplay between data, computation, visualization, and humans to augment intelligence.  My work usually falls into one of three categories (I) technical contributions, (II) domain-driven techniques, and (III) empirical/theoretical work. 

As an example for a technical contribution, I will introduce my vision for “Literate Visualization”, an analogy to Knuth’s “Literate Programming”, which is widely used in the form of computational notebooks in data science today. We can leverage provenance data of an analysis session to create well-documented and annotated visualization stories that enable reproducibility and sharing. By semi-automatically inferring analyst's intents for operations such as brushing, aggregating, filtering, etc., we can improve reproducibility and enable reusability, which in turn also allows us to seamlessly bridge between interactive workflows and computational workflows. 

To showcase my domain-driven work, I will describe a technique we developed to analyze large clinical genealogies with the purpose of identifying suicide cases that have a likely genetic component."
