In visualization, provenance is widely used for action recovery, to document analysis processes, and to analyze user behavior. In this talk, however, I will focus on an exciting application of provenance: to bridge between code-based and interactive and visual data analysis. Code-based and interactive data analysis have different strengths and weaknesses. Some operations can be more easily executed in one than in the other. Interactive visualization tends to be more “natural” and easier to understand, but code-based analysis is typically more reproducible. While traditionally these two approaches can’t be easily combined, I’ll show how we can leverage provenance data to tackle these issues and design a truly integrated analysis environment.
