Jack is a data visualization software developer with the Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute at the University of Utah. Through his work, Jack leads development efforts on over $3,000,000 of grant funded research into a broad range of topics, including multivariate network visualizations, neuromodulation therapy databases, and patient blood management analysis tools. Another critical part of Jack's work is mentoring PhD students in the Visualization Design Lab and helping the lab make quality, maintainable software. He obtained a Bachelor of Science Degree in Mathematics from Westminster College in Salt Lake City and is currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Utah.

In his prior work, Jack developed machine learning models for national banks and created custom lifetime value solutions for many US companies. Ultimately, Jack has developed and implemented tools that cover the whole data science stack, and he's comfortable explaining the complex technical topics to stakeholders from any background.

Jack's hobbies include:
- Taking Pusha (his cat) kayaking/hiking
- Rock climbing
- Spending quality time with his partner sampling Salt Lake City's best cocktails.
