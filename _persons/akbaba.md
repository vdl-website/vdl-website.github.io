I am a PhD student in the School of Computing working with Miriah Meyer. In my work, I focus on understanding the role that design and technology plays in people's ability to find information and create lasting understanding. Inspired by great interdisciplinary thinkers before me, I hope to emulate work that is as thoughtful and inventive in the realm of data visualization.
