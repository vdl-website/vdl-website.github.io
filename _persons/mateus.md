I am a PhD student at the Kahlert School of Computing completing a research rotation
under the supervision of [Alexander Lex](https://vdl.sci.utah.edu/team/lex/). My
prior research experience used tools from Computational Topology to develop
provably robust Machine Learning methods suitable for high-dimensional spaces with
non-Euclidean structure. Most recently, I work on Digital Accessibility with the
long-term goal of making the web a more inclusive and participatory space for all.

In support of my research efforts, I was awarded the [Google DeepMind Post-Graduate
Fellowship](https://www.deepmind.com/scholarships) in 2020 and the [University of Utah
Graduate Research Fellowship](https://gradschool.utah.edu/funding/fellowships-scholarships-awards/grad-school-administered/graduate-research-fellowship.php)
in 2022. Prior to these awards, I completed a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science from
[Westminster College](https://wcmo.edu) jointly advised by Professor Peng Yu, Professor
[Erin Martin](https://www.lindenwood.edu/about/directories/faculty-staff-directory/details/emartin/),
and Professor [Christopher Mooney](https://sites.google.com/site/chrismooneymath/).
Before that, I was a [Davis Scholar](https://www.davisuwcscholars.org/) at [UWC-USA](https://www.uwc-usa.org/).
