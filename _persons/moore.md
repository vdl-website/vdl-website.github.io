My research centers on how everyday people engage with technology, and how we can make their experience more intuitive.  I was co-advised by [Miriah Meyer](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~miriah/) and [Jason Weise](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~wiese/) and worked on the National Institute of Health's [PRISMS](https://www.nibib.nih.gov/research-funding/prisms) project.  The goal of this project was to help "develop health monitoring systems for measuring environmental, physiological, and behavioral factors in pediatric epidemiological studies of asthma".  My contributions involved working closely with users to understand how they thought about their data, then developing and deploying interactive visualizations to help them visualize this information.

I'm a bit of an atypical CS student, and even more so a visualization researcher.  My academic background is in math and physics with some professional R&D experience as an electro-optic engineer for spice. I came to Utah for a scientific computing PhD, but switched course to visualization in order to pursue a more collaborative and problem-driven line of research.

When I'm not working I like to cook and play synthesizers.
