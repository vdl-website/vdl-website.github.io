My research is on data visualization and human computer interaction. I design, build, and study interactive visual data analysis solutions to aid researchers in data driven fields, such as biology and medicine, in understanding and communicating complex data sets. I also investigate how to make visualization reproducible, how to integrate visualizations with computational workflows, and how to make data visualizations accessible to blind and low-vision users. Finally, I also develop infrastructure for crowd-sourced user studies.  

## Bio

I am an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute and the Kahlert School of Computing at the University of Utah. I direct the Visualization Design Lab where we develop visualization methods and systems to help solve today’s scientific problems.

I am the recipient of an NSF CAREER award and multiple best paper awards or honorable mentions at IEEE VIS, ACM CHI, and other conferences. I also received a best dissertation award from my alma mater. I co-founded [Datavisyn](http://datavisyn.io), a startup company developing visualization solutions for the pharmaceutical industry. I am an associate editor for IEEE TVCG and IEEE CG&A, and I served as area papers chair for IEEE VIS in 2021 and 2023. In addition to writing papers, our lab publishes a lot of visualization software. My most popular tool is [UpSet, a set visualization technique](http://upset.app/). Other tools include [reVISit](https://revisit.dev/), a platform for designing online user sutdies, [MultiNet](https://multinet.app/), a network visualization platform and [trrack](https://github.com/trrack/), a library for tracking provenance in interactive applications. You can find other software on our [GitHub Page](https://github.com/visdesignlab).

I currently serve as the Director of Graduate Studies for the Kahlert School of Computing, overseeing more than 500 graduate students. Before joining the University of Utah, I was a lecturer and post-doctoral visualization researcher at Harvard University. I received my PhD, master’s, and undergraduate degrees from Graz University of Technology. In 2011 I was a visiting researcher at Harvard Medical School.
