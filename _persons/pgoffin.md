I currently work on NIH's PRISMS project which is about "developing sensor-based, integrated health monitoring systems for measuring environmental, physiological, and behavioral factors in pediatric epidemiological studies of asthma", and the AQ and U project which is about understanding air quality in urban environments.

I received my PhD in Computer Science from Universit√© Paris-Saclay in 2016, where I worked with Jean-Daniel Fekete and Petra Isenberg on how to integrate small data-driven visualizations (word-scale visualizations) into text. Before that I studied Computer Science at ETH Zurich in Switzerland.
