Two VDL members will be at the EG/VGTC EuroVis conference in Barcelona. Be sure to say hello, come to our talks, and we look forward to connecting with everyone at the conference!

Our talks:

 * Ethan Kerzner is presenting [his paper on new techniques for visualizing connectivity in large graphs](http://vdl.sci.utah.edu/publications/2017_eurovis_graffinity/) . Be sure to check out his nice walkthrough video of the technique and the [open-source implementation](https://github.com/visdesignlab/graffinity).
 * Sean McKenna is presenting [his work on a design space of visual narrative flow for how people read stories](http://vdl.sci.utah.edu/publications/2017_eurovis_narrative-flow/). We will show off example stories from our corpus, user studies, and our own [example story showcasing story variations](https://narrative-flow.github.io/bar-chart-story/).
