[If you could see how chores impact your homeâ€™s air quality, you might do them differently!](https://www.sltrib.com/news/2018/10/06/if-you-could-see-how/) This piece is based on [new research](http://vdl.sci.utah.edu/publications/2018_imwut_maav/)  by VDL members [Jimmy Moore](http://vdl.sci.utah.edu/team/moore/), [Pascal Goffin](http://vdl.sci.utah.edu/persons/pgoffin/), [Miriah Meyer](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~miriah/), and the School of Computing's [Jason Wiese](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~wiese/) to help local families see the unseen with indoor air quality senors.  The one article your child doesn't want you to read!

This work appears in the September issue of [Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies (IMWUT)](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3264938) and will be presented at [UbiComp2018](http://ubicomp.org/ubicomp2018/index.html) in Singapore.
