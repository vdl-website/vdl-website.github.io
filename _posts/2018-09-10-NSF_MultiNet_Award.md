Miriah Meyer and Alexander Lex, in collaboration with teams from Kitware, the University of Idaho, Knowedge Vis, Duke University, and the Carnegie Institution of Science, have received an [award](/projects/2019-nsf-multinet/) from NSF's Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure to develop a web-based reproducible visual analysis platform for multivariate networks. We're very excited about this project and about the prospect of working with this amazing team!
