After an incredible decade at the University of Utah, the Visualization Design Lab (VDL) is entering a new chapter: the lab is **partially relocating to Graz University of Technology (TU Graz)** in Austria. This will be a gradual transition: only Alex will be moving, while the rest of the team remains in Utah. For the foreseeable future, the lab will operate **across two continents**.

VDL’s new home in Austria will be the [Institute of Human-Centred Computing](https://hcc.tugraz.at/) at [TU Graz](https://tugraz.at/).

**Alex will be hiring a PhD student and a Postdoctoral Fellow in Graz. Check out the [positions page]({{site.base_url}}/positions/) for details.**


## A Brief History of the Visualization Design Lab

The Visualization Design Lab was founded when [Alex]({{site.base_url}}/team/lex) joined the University of Utah and teamed up with [Miriah](https://miriah.github.io/) in 2015. From then until 2021, Miriah and Alex co-directed the lab, leading numerous projects and mentoring many students.

In 2021, Miriah moved to Linköping University in Sweden, where she founded the [Visualization and Interaction Design Group](https://visidlab.github.io/).

In 2025, Alex returned to his alma mater in Graz to continue VDL's research mission at TU Graz.

This website will reflect the **new phase of the lab in Austria**, while continuing to **preserve the history, people, and publications** from the Utah chapter. For archival purposes, the final version of the Utah VDL site will remain available at  
[https://vdl.sci.utah.edu](https://vdl.sci.utah.edu).
