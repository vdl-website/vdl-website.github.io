## Current Openings

We are currently seeking a **Postdoctoral Researcher** in data visualization.  
**Application deadline:** August 27, 2025

For full details and application instructions, please visit the [official job posting](https://jobs.tugraz.at/en/jobs/bf51ab70-8f5e-885b-52cf-685aa426c346)

We are also planning to **recruit new PhD students** soon. If you're interested in pursuing a PhD with us, we encourage you to [get in touch](mailto:alex@visdesignlab.net) early to discuss potential opportunities.


## General Information

We are always looking for talented and motivated individuals to join the Vis Design Lab as **PhD students** or **Postdoctoral Fellows** in the area of **data visualization**.

The **Graz University of Technology (TU Graz)** is one of the leading institutions for computer science and engineering in Austria, located in the vibrant and historic university town of **Graz**.

Our group takes a **problem-driven approach** to visualization research, working closely with collaborators across disciplines — from the sciences to the humanities — to design novel techniques and tools that support **exploratory, complex data analysis**.

### Current Research Topics

We are particularly interested in the following areas:

- User studies and infrastructure for user studies  
- Accessibility in data visualization  
- Misinformation and visualization  
- Expert knowledge and its relationship to data  
- Bridging code-based and interactive analysis workflows  
- Visualization techniques for multivariate and heterogeneous data  
- Biomedical visualization: genomic data, biological networks, patient data  
- Design studies  
- Scalable, web-based visualization systems  
- Methods and models for applied visualization research  
- Perceptual and cognitive principles for visualization  
- Visualization for communication and behavior change  
- Provenance tracking, reproducibility, and storytelling  


## PhD Students

PhD students are enrolled in TU Graz’s **doctoral program**. At present, a **completed MS degree** is required for admission, but we are actively exploring pathways for **Bachelor’s graduates** — please [contact us](mailto:alex@visdesignlab.net) if that applies to you.

We welcome applicants from computer science and related fields, but also from diverse backgrounds such as **bioinformatics, mathematics, physics, design, or psychology**. Strong written and verbal communication skills are essential.

There is **no fixed application deadline**: applications are reviewed on a rolling basis.


## Postdoctoral Fellows

We are seeking outstanding candidates with a strong track record in **visualization research**. Postdoctoral fellows are expected to:

- Develop a research agenda aligned with our focus areas  
- Manage projects and coordinate with collaborators and lab members  
- Mentor graduate and undergraduate students  
- Lead and contribute to publications  
- Support grant writing activities  

### Requirements

Candidates must hold a **PhD in computer science** or a related field and have a **strong publication record** in top visualization and/or HCI venues. Additional desired qualifications include:

- Excellent programming skills  
- Familiarity with modern software development practices  
- Experience collaborating with domain experts  
- A broad understanding of evaluation methods  
- Motivation, initiative, and willingness to learn  
- Strong written and verbal communication skills  

While specific openings will be posted on this page, feel free to submit:

- Your CV  
- A research statement  
- PDFs of your best papers  
- Contact information for three references  

Send materials to [alex@visdesignlab.net](mailto:alex@visdesignlab.net). We look forward to hearing from you!
