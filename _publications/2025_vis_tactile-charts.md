abstract: "
We investigate whether tactile charts support comprehension and learning of complex visualizations for blind and low-vision (BLV) individuals and contribute four tactile chart designs and an interview study. Visualizations are powerful tools for conveying data, yet BLV individuals typically can rely only on assistive technologies—primarily alternative texts—to access this information. Prior research shows the importance of mental models of chart types for interpreting these descriptions, yet BLV individuals have no means to build such a mental model based on images of visualizations. Tactile charts show promise to fill this gap in supporting the process of building mental models. Yet studies on tactile data representations mostly focus on simple chart types, and it is unclear whether they are also appropriate for more complex charts as would be found in scientific publications. Working with two BLV researchers, we designed 3D-printed tactile template charts with exploration instructions for four advanced chart types: UpSet plots, violin plots, clustered heatmaps, and faceted line charts. We then conducted an interview study with 12 BLV participants comparing whether using our tactile templates improves mental models and understanding of charts and whether this understanding translates to novel datasets experienced through alt texts. Thematic analysis shows that tactile models support chart type understanding and are the preferred learning method by BLV individuals. We also report participants' opinions on tactile chart design and their role in BLV education.
