abstract: "<p>
This dissertation establishes a new visualization design process model devised
to guide visualization designers in building more effective and useful
visualization systems and tools. The novelty of this framework includes its
flexibility for iteration, actionability for guiding visualization designers
with concrete steps, concise yet methodical definitions, and connections to
other visualization design models commonly used in the field of data
visualization. In summary, the design activity framework breaks down the
visualization design process into a series of four design activities:
<em>understand</em>, <em>ideate</em>, <em>make</em>, and <em>deploy</em>. For
each activity, the framework prescribes a descriptive motivation, list of design
methods, and expected visualization artifacts.
</p>

<p>
To elucidate the framework, two case studies for visualization design illustrate
these concepts, methods, and artifacts in real-world projects in the field of
cybersecurity. For example, these projects employ user-centered design methods,
such as personas and data sketches, which emphasize our teams' motivations and
visualization artifacts with respect to the design activity framework. These
case studies also serve as examples for novice visualization designers, and we
hypothesized that the framework could serve as a pedagogical tool for teaching
and guiding novices through their own design process to create a visualization
tool.
</p>

<p>
To externally evaluate the efficacy of this framework, we created worksheets for
each design activity, outlining a series of concrete, tangible steps for
novices. In order to validate the design worksheets, we conducted 13 student
observations over the course of two months, received 32 online survey responses,
and performed a qualitative analysis of 11 in-depth interviews. Students found
the worksheets both useful and effective for framing the visualization design
process. Next, by applying the design activity framework to technique-driven and
evaluation-based research projects, we brainstormed possible extensions to the
design model. Lastly, we examined implications of the design activity framework
and present future work in this space. The visualization community is challenged
to consider on how to more effectively describe, capture, and communicate the
complex, iterative nature of data visualization design throughout research,
design, development, and deployment of visualization systems and tools.
