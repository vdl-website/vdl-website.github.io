abstract: "
<p>Considering node and edge attribute is crucial for many network exploration and analysis tasks.
However, effective visualization of both structure and attributes is a challenging problem, especially for dense graphs.
In this poster, we introduce TaMax, a technique designed to visualize dense multivariate graphs with a diverse set of node and edge attributes based on adjacency matrices.
In TaMax, node attributes are visualized in a table that is juxtaposed with the matrix, while edge attributes visualized in the cells.
We investigate different ways to visualize multiple edge attributes: dividing each cells into sub-cells showing different edge attributes or overlaying a secondary attribute with opacity over a cell.
Furthermore, TaMax addresses the scalability problem by allowing flexible grouping based on node attributes and querying based on edge attributes.</p>
