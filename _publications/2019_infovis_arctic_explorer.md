abstract: "
<p>The Arctic seascape plays an important role in North American trade and defense; however, over recent years, the Arctic has undergone radical changes, altering current shipping routes and opening up new previously blocked paths. This work presents Arctic Explorer, a tool to visualize sea-ice concentration along paths over time. Arctic Explorer could be used to circumnavigate areas expected to be blocked with ice and discover new routes that may have opened up. </p>"
