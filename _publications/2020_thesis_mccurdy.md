abstract: "<p>In applied visualization research, artifacts are shaped by a series of small design decisions, many of which are evaluated quickly and informally via methods that often go unreported and unverified. Such design decisions are influenced not only by visualization theory, but also by the people and context of the research. While existing applied visualization models support a level of reliability throughout the design process, they fail to explicitly address the influence of the research context in shaping the resulting design artifacts. In this work, we look to action design research (ADR) for insight into this gap. In particular, ADR offers a framework along with a set of guiding principles for navigating and capitalizing on the disruptive, subjective, human-centered nature of applied design research, while aiming to ensure the reliability of the process and design. This dissertation explores the utility of ADR for applied visualization research. Our exploration is grounded in a formative design study with poetry scholars, informed by preliminary theoretical research into the ADR framework, and developed in two consecutive design studies â€” the first in collaboration with global health experts, and the second in collaboration with astronomers and astrophysicists. Our exploratory results validate ADR as a useful model for strengthening the visualization research process, while also revealing significant gaps that pose important areas for future visualization research. Primary contributions of this dissertation include an articulation of the gaps in existing visualization methodology, an exploration of action design research for applied visualization design, and a reflective synthesis of the exploratory results. Secondary contributions stem from the results of the three design studies and reflect the development of our research thinking around artifacts, the emergent design process, and the generation of visualization knowledge.</p>"
