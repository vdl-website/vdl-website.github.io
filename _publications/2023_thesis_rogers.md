abstract:  "
<p>Reproducibility and replicability are pillars of the scientific method used to build
confidence in scientific findings. In the wake of a replication crisis, more attention has
been brought to these pillars within computer science and, specifically, the subfield of
visualization. However, visualization covers a spectrum of approaches, from quantitative
approaches such as algorithms development and perception studies to design-oriented or
qualitative work in which the subjective, situated nature of the work is not intended to be
reproducible. An open question remains within the visualization community: how do we, as
a research community, make nonreproducible work scrutinizable? The primary contribution
of this dissertation is a definition and characterization of traceability as complimentary
to reproducibility for scrutinizing non-empirical work and an investigation in supporting
a traceable research process. This dissertation also contributes a software prototype that
implements user interfaces and visualizations supporting these methods. Four projects
described in this dissertation informed understanding of traceability for design-oriented
visualization research. The first project was a motivation to challenge the status quo for
the design study process and reporting, as current best practices did not support process
transparency. Diverging from current practices in subsequent work, this work focused on
methodological experimentation with criteria for rigor to improve transparency. This project
was the impetus for defining traceability. The third project conceptualized traceability to
support transparency for design-oriented visualization research and a vision of how to
support traceability through a visualization tool. Finally, this dissertation investigated how
traceability transfers to applications outside of design-oriented visualization research in the
final piece of work. Conjointly, these projects sketch a path for how the research community
can make design-oriented and qualitative work rigorous, traceable, and scrutinizable.</p>"
